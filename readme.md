# rpb

## PouchDB demo with local storage (built with Parcel)

All data resides only within the browser, no server required.

This demo let's you create databases, sync them with one another, edit and delete documents.

The `demo` db is seeded with the content of [initial-batch.json](static/initial-batch.json) on page load.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/millette/rpb.git
cd rpb
npm install
npm run build # next, launch webserver from dist/ directory
npm run start # if you are developping, use this
```
